# DigitX-Project
This project was made for real-time  recognition of hand-written digits using OpenCV in python and Keras
To be able to see this project working you must install openCV and Keras then excute the file called mnist first to save the model and finally excute CV2 

###This Repo contains two python files as follows : 
mnist : where the convolutional neural network is implemented using Keras and this file must be excuted first
CV2 : where you will find the OpenCV code to predict the numbers usind the model saved from mnist file
